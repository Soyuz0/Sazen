# Agent-First Browser Plan

## Product Goal
Build an agent-first Chromium runtime where structured state is primary, actions are atomic/replayable, and humans can watch execution in a visible browser with real-time logs.

## Locked Constraints
- TypeScript implementation.
- Visible Chromium by default (headed mode).
- Real-time logs and action stream.
- Deterministic-first behavior for reproducible testing.
- Structured DOM snapshots with stable IDs.
- Session save/load and trace replay.

## Architecture
Agent -> Control API -> Orchestrator -> Chromium (Playwright + CDP) -> State/Trace Store

- **Control API:** JSON command contract for actions and results.
- **Orchestrator:** Intent -> atomic operations with stable waits/retries.
- **Runtime:** Browser lifecycle, tabs, contexts, mocks.
- **State Layer:** snapshots, diffs, logs, network, timing, artifacts.

## Feature Pillars
1. **Deterministic Execution**
   - Reduced motion + disabled animations.
   - Fixed seed random/time shims.
   - Wait-for-stable heuristics.
   - Trace replay with consistency checks.

2. **Structured DOM Interface**
   - Node IDs, role/name, visibility, interactability, bbox.
   - Stable semantic references.
   - Token-optimized output mode.

3. **Atomic Action API**
   - navigate/click/fill/select/press/wait/snapshot/mock.
   - Every action returns status + dom diff + logs + network + timings.

4. **Observability**
   - Console, network, page errors, request failures.
   - Layout shift + paint/navigation timing collection.
   - Real-time event feed in CLI.

5. **Persistence + Replay**
   - Save storage state + URL checkpoints.
   - Save action traces to disk.
   - Deterministic replay with hash comparison.

## Initial Deliverables (v0)
- Headed Chromium runtime.
- Action execution engine with deterministic mode.
- Structured snapshot + DOM diff engine.
- Real-time logs + network capture.
- CLI (`open`, `run`, `inspect`, `snapshot`, `replay`).

## Validation Strategy
- Build local fixture app for dogfooding.
- Run scripted flow against fixture using visible browser.
- Verify per-action diffs/logs/network bundles.
- Run replay and validate expected vs actual DOM hashes.

## Cross-Site Validation Coverage
- Added multi-site scripted flows in `examples/site-flows` for: example, wikipedia, mdn, nodejs, github, python, vite, hn, rust, bbc, react, books.
- Each flow performs navigation + at least one interaction step (click/fill/search).
- Ran matrix repeatedly; latest full pass: 12/12 successful flows with no new blocking bugs.
- Verified replay behavior on dynamic/public traces: strict mode surfaces real DOM drift, relaxed mode validates stable invariants.
- Final consecutive matrix pass after replay/flake enhancements also succeeded: 12/12 sites, 0 failures.

## Executed Fixes from Cross-Site Runs
- Implemented locator candidate fallback chain (test id, id, href, name attr, role/name, css path).
- Implemented strict-mode disambiguation by defaulting target locators to `.first()` and trying ranked alternatives.
- Implemented stableRef ranking to prefer visible/actionable matches when duplicate semantic refs exist.
- Implemented bounded stability waits to avoid 10s stalls on chatty sites (short network-idle budget + quiet window).
- Improved action resilience by degrading gracefully when post-action snapshot/perf/screenshot capture fails.
- Added ambiguous-target fixture + integration test to prevent regressions in multi-match role targeting.
- Added site matrix runner (`npm run smoke:sites`) and machine-readable summary output.

- Added timeline filters/artifact visibility for quicker failure triage.

- Replaced unstable ebay smoke flow with books.toscrape flow for deterministic e-commerce-style coverage.
- Added profile command wrappers to simplify session save/load workflows for role-based testing.

## Continuous Roadmap Additions

## Base Plan Milestones (M1-M3)

### M1 - Run Control Surface (Done)
- Deliverables:
  - CLI `run` exposes control socket (`--control-socket`).
  - New `run-control` command supports `pause`, `resume`, and `state` from a separate process.
  - Control state returns pause sources, elapsed pause time, and run progress metadata.
- Validation:
  - `npm run build`
  - `npm test`
  - Manual: run script + send `run-control state/pause/resume` against socket.

### M2 - Pause Provenance + Intervention Journal (Done)
- Deliverables:
  - Trace persists `interventions` with `pre/post` URL and DOM hash.
  - Timeline includes provenance marker rows: `pause_start` and `pause_resume`.
  - Timeline renderers expose control metadata for auditability.
- Validation:
  - Unit: trace timeline coverage with control markers.
  - Integration: session pause/resume records intervention entry in saved trace.

### M3 - Tooling Compatibility + Baseline Safety (Done)
- Deliverables:
  - Visual diff engine ignores control-marker rows so screenshot step alignment remains stable.
  - Bundle manifest includes intervention journal entries.
  - Overlay controls remain excluded from DOM snapshots/diff hashes.
- Validation:
  - `npm run build`
  - `npm test`
  - Existing replay/visual/timeline suites stay green.

- **Goal graph planner:** model tasks as precondition/postcondition graphs instead of only linear scripts.

### Advanced Differentiators
- **DOM+vision grounding:** combine accessibility tree targeting with visual region matching.
- **Counterfactual replay analysis:** rerun failing steps under controlled perturbations to isolate root causes.
- **Policy guardrail engine:** enforce declarative allow/deny rules for navigation, actions, and data movement.
- **Human checkpoint handoff:** pause for approval and let humans take over headed sessions in place.
- **Trace provenance query layer:** answer "why this action" using a searchable action/event graph.

## Agent-IDE Integration (Planned)
